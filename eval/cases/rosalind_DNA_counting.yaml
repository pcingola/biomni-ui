  A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word;
  the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains. An example of a length 21 DNA string
  (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG." Given this DNA string
  "AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC"
  Return Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s
timeout_s: 300

expect:
  must_contain:
    - "20"
    - "12"
    - "17"
    - "21"
