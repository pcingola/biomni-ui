  Given a collection of DNA strings representing contigs, we use the N statistic NXX (where XX ranges from 01 to 99) to represent the maximum positive integer L
  such that the total number of nucleotides of all contigs having length â‰¥L
  is at least XX% of the sum of contig lengths. The most commonly used such statistic is N50, although N75 is also worth mentioning.

  Given a collection of at most 1000 DNA strings given in FASTA format (whose combined length does not exceed 50 kbp).

  Return N50 and N75 for this collection of strings.
