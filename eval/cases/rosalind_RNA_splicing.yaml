  Problem
  After identifying the exons and introns of an RNA string, we only need to delete the introns and concatenate the exons to form a new string ready for translation.

  Given A DNA string s (of length at most 1 kbp) and a collection of substrings of s acting as introns. All strings are given in FASTA format.

  Return A protein string resulting from transcribing and translating the exons of s. (Note: Only one solution will exist for the dataset provided.)

    Check if the protein string is correctly derived from the given DNA string by removing introns and translating the exons. Penalize incorrect or speculative answers.
