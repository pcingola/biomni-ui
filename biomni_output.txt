Is SRY a gene?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

I need to check if SRY is a gene. Let me search for information about SRY to determine its status as a gene.

## Plan:
1. [ ] Search for SRY in gene databases to confirm if it's a gene
2. [ ] Get detailed information about SRY if it is a gene
3. [ ] Provide a comprehensive answer about SRY's status as a gene

Let me start by searching for SRY in gene databases.

<execute>
# First, let's search for SRY using UniProt to see if it's a known gene/protein
from biomni.tool.database import query_uniprot

print("=== Searching for SRY in UniProt database ===")
uniprot_result = query_uniprot("Find information about SRY gene")
print(uniprot_result)
</execute>

from biomni.tool.database import query_ensembl

print("=== Searching for SRY in Ensembl database ===")
ensembl_result = query_ensembl("Find information about SRY gene in human")
print(ensembl_result)

Title: Sex disparity of liver cancer recurrence following surgery: sex-determining region Y gene promotes immunosuppressive microenvironment and favors metastasis.
Abstract: Male sex is a risk factor of the development and prognosis of primary liver cancers. However, sex difference of tumor recurrence following curative resection and the underlying mechanism needs to be clarified.
Sex and outcomes among patients undergoing resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) were investigated in two international multi-institutional databases. Murine model of postoperative HCC recurrence was used following hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury to mimic surgical injury in hepatocyte-specific sex determining region Y gene (SRY) knock-in (KI) and knockout (KO) mice, as well as wildtypes (WTs).
Men had a significantly worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) following curative resection of HCC or ICC versus women (5-year RFS: HCC, men 30.0% vs. women 43.9%, P = 0.041; ICC, men 18.7% vs. women 26.8%, P = 0.006, respectively) in the matched cohort. Male mice consistently developed larger recurrent tumor versus females after hepatic I/R injury, accompanied by increased polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) and decreased CD8+ T cells. Of note, SRY KI in both male and female mice increased, whereas SRY KO decreased tumor recurrence upon I/R injury. Moreover, SRY was associated with increased immunosuppressive PMN-MDSCs and decreased CD8+ T cells in both patient and murine livers after I/R injury. Mechanistically, hepatocyte SRY recruited PMN-MDSCs to the liver microenvironment following I/R injury through NF-κB-dependent CXCL1 secretion.
Men are more likely to recur than women after liver resection of liver cancers. SRY promotes immunosuppressive microenvironment in the liver and accounts for male susceptibility of liver cancer recurrence. Targeting SRY-NFκB-CXCL1 axis may have potential value in male-specific surveillance and immunomodulatory therapy of primary liver cancer.

Title: Male sex reversal syndrome: a disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD) with infertility.
Abstract: 46,XX male sex reversal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder where individuals with a 46,XX karyotype present with male phenotypic characteristics despite the absence of an Y chromosome. We report a case of a male in his early 30s, presenting with infertility and azoospermia, with bilateral small testes, but no other sexual dysfunction or any signs of hypovirulisation. His hormonal evaluation revealed hypogonadism with normal gonadotropin levels. Genetic testing showed a 46,XX karyotype with the presence of the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY) gene and microdeletions in the azoospermia factor region, confirming the diagnosis of SRY-positive 46,XX male sex reversal syndrome. As sperm retrieval was not recommended, the couple pursued donor insemination, resulting in conception during the first cycle. The female partner is now in her third trimester of pregnancy. Testosterone replacement therapy was initiated for hypogonadism, and long-term follow-up was recommended for monitoring therapy and neoplastic risk. This case intends to provide an overview focused on improving diagnostic and management strategies for 46,XX male sex reversal syndrome, emphasising the necessity of genetic evaluation for all patients with hypogonadism and azoospermia presenting with infertility, not limited to those with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. It also highlights the critical role of a multidisciplinary approach in the effective management of this condition.

Title: The SOX12-YBX1-LDHA signaling axis drives metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Abstract: The sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box (SOX) family plays crucial roles in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. However, the precise function of SOX12 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) metastasis remains to be investigated. In this study, we analyzed single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets and demonstrated significant upregulation of SOX12 in PTC, which is associated with poor prognosis in PTC patients. Functional assays demonstrated that SOX12 overexpression promoted the metastasis of PTC cells, whereas the downregulation of SOX12 markedly reduced the aggressiveness of PTC. By integrating RNA-seq, CUT&Tag, and immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we found that SOX12 directly upregulated YBX1 expression and recruited it to the LDHA promoter, thus leading to activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Crucially, LDHA knockdown rescued SOX12/YBX1-mediated TGF-β signaling activation and inhibited the migration and invasion of PTC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SOX12 expression is positively correlated with YBX1 and LDHA expression levels in clinical PTC samples. Taken together, these results reveal a critical link between the SOX12-YBX1-LDHA signaling axis and PTC metastasis and suggest that targeting of this signaling node may be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy to combat PTC metastasis.
